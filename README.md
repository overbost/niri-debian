Niri deb package

# This is a Debian package to install Niri.

Niri has been compiled following the official documentation, it does not contain any customizations.
To have a more functional environment it is necessary to install wofi, waybar, dunst and similar applications separately.

If you have configuration files to suggest, contact me to create a package containing the customizations together.

The executable has been created with Debian 12 following the instructions, no modifications have been made, no guarantee is given on the functioning or the content of the package,  use at your own risk.

The package has been tested on Debian 12 bookworm.
